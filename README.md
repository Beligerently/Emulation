# Emulation

## I do not condone piracy of any sort, pirating the intellectual property of another company could result in legal action being taken against you by the company in question. That being said, please use your own game dumps, keys and bios files for the emulators.

## What is the goal of this repo?
The goal of this repo is to compile a massive list of emulators available for every console that is able to be emulated. My personal goal is to make it as simple as possible to find and download the emulators so that everyone can play games that they enjoy, whether it be on a phone or on a PC.

## Note: At the moment im working on a website to simplify all this and make everyones lives easier, that being said updates will be slow.

### Completed 31/40 of listed systems
### Completed 31/134 consoles in existence
